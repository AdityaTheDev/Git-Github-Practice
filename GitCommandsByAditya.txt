// This contains the commands that I learned when learning GIT and GITHUB

open a file and go to the respective dir in cmd

initialize git using : git init

Add required files or add the required changes

T know the status : git status

if the file is not added then add : git add .

Commit the file : git commit -m " "


Connecting the github account:

Copy the github repo url, then

use : git remote add origin url

Commiting files to github Repo:

git push origin master


// Now lets learn how to contribute to Opensource projects:

First fork the repoistery

then clone the project that you want to contribute : git clone url

make changes in your local clone project

move the cmd dir to the folder where you made changes

check git status : git status

if the git didnt recognize the change then add the file : git add .

Create a new branch : git branch newbranch

move the branch from master to new branch : git checkout newbranch

then add the changes : git add .

commit the changes : git commit -m " "

push your branch to the owners project : git push origin branchname

Succesfully Pushed. Now go online and create a Pull request.

If your contribution(code) is error free then the owner of the project will MERGE it to the master branch of the project.


// FUN FACT
   
This file was written,committed using cmd and git commands by following the above mentioned steps.
